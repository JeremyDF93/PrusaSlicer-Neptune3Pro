# PrusaSlicer Neptune 3 Pro/Plus/Max Config Bundle
I found the [official](https://github.com/NARUTOfzr/PrusaSlicer-Neptune) config bundle to be a complete mess with inherit issues and limited customizability, so I started from scratch using the Creality bundle as a template.

## Usage
1. Download the [latest](/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) release and extract the archive.
2. Import `Elegoo.ini` as config bundle shown below.
